Truckload O' Tests is a Baldi's Basics Plus mod created by TXV123Ham for Version 0.7 of Baldi's Basics Plus. This repository serves as an updated version of the mod since it's initial release and removal.

### History
Truckload O' Tests was initially released on September 22, 2024 at 1:45 AM GMT by TXV123Ham.

The mod recieved seemingly positive reception, with fifteen thousand views on GameBanana and was made featured under the Baldi's Basics section of the site.

The mod would remain avaliable for a little under six months, before being trashed on March 21, 2025 at 3:06 AM GMT.

TXV123Ham expanded on the trashing with a forum thread briefly discussing what occured:

> Yesterday as I am writing this, I had trashed the Truckload O' Tests page due to what I had found out about someone who helped with most of the mod. All I'm gonna say is that it was really bad. I shall not publicly discuss it here.

> As for the fate of the mod, it's not gonna be gone, it will be back, however there will be many changes. I shall not go into detail of these changes either except that the mod will have a different name.

> I apologize for the worries people got from finding about the trashing.

As of June 8, 2025, it's updated release has not been released or further elaborated on.

### Search
With the mod's trashing in March 2025, the mod was labeled as lost media, and any attempts of recovering it were futile.

A handful of leads includes but are not limited to:

- Content made over YouTube, however, every creator contacted no longer had the mod on their system
- Assets posted on a Fandom wiki, where a bureaucrat who uploaded a couple of assets also didn't have the mod
- Threads were found on the Baldi subreddit, based on users asking for a download and attempts in finding the mod

It wasn't until June 6, 2025, when a lead over on Discord originating from the Baldi's Basics Mod Discord popped up; two current server members were contacted who previously mentioned the mod back in 2024 had a build of the mod, which would have made the mod partially found. However, one of these members turned up with the assets, completing the search.

From that point, I've worked away at restoring a functional Visual Studio project of the mod, repairing it for the latest Baldi's Basics Plus updates, correcting bugs in the original release, plus cleaning and organizing what I then had.

As of June 8, 2025, it is now at the proper state of an open source release.

### Notes
This repository is not affilated with the original Truckload O' Tests development team, nor did I contribute to it when it was initially avaliable. I simply refurbished it's code and made the mod functional for the later Baldi's Basics Plus updates that came after the mod's release and takendown. **All credit for Truckload O' Tests goes towards this team for their work on this mod.**

If you are an individual who was a lead developer of the original mod, please shoot me a DM on Discord: __dev9998__<br>
Any specification on the publicity of this repository would be greatly appreciated.
